    <p>
        The world happiness report is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness. 
        The report ranks countries by how happy their citizens perceive themselves to be. 
        The report is based on data from the Gallup World Poll, which asks people to evaluate their lives on a scale from 0 to 10.
        The report also includes data on the countryâ€™s <strong>GDP per capita, healthy life expectancy, freedom, generosity, and Trust.</strong>
        The report is published annually by the <strong>United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network.</strong>
