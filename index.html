    <h2>Trust and World Happiness: Bar Chart Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The bar chart visually represents the correlation between trust levels and world happiness. 
        Each bar on the chart corresponds to a specific region or country, and the height of the bar 
        indicates the level of trust within that region. The x-axis displays the different regions or countries, 
        while the y-axis represents the trust levels, ranging from low to high.
        Regions with higher bars depict a stronger correlation between trust and happiness, 
        emphasizing the importance of trust in fostering a happier society.

Each point on the plot represents a country, with its position indicating its GDP and happiness score. A dropdown menu allows the user to select a specific region, highlighting the countries in that region on the scatter plot.
